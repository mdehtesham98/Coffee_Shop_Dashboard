# Coffee Shop Employee Project 

This project is an Excel-based dashboard designed to manage and analyze employee information in a coffee shop setting.  

Hereâ€™s what I worked on:
 ðŸ”¹ Total employees & role-wise distribution;
 ðŸ”¹ Full-time vs part-time segmentation;
 ðŸ”¹ Weekly worked hours & salary calculations;
 ðŸ”¹ Used key Excel formulas: SUM, IF, VLOOKUP, RANDBETWEEN, and applied cell locking for accuracy;
 ðŸ”¹ Designed a dashboard to bring all insights together on one sheet.

The goal of this project is to provide small businesses with a simple and effective way to monitor staff performance and payroll using Microsoft Excel.
